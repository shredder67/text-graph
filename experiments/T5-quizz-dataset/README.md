When training this model, an attempt was made to format the data for training the model differently: instead of feeding a question and seeing what the most likely continuation of the text was, we fed the training data in the format "Question: A) answer. B) answer. C) answer...". And tried to train T5 on the correct answers. This did not make much progress. Apparently, because there is some error in training the model.
